# Refreshing & Caching

## When data updates

- All enabled providers refresh together: at launch, then every 5 minutes (a fixed cadence — there's no setting for it). Providers fetch in parallel — one slow provider doesn't delay the others.
- The popover footer shows `Next update in Nm`. **Clicking it (or ⌘R)** refreshes immediately, skipping the cache.
- While a provider is fetching, a small spinner appears next to its name (and one shows in the footer beside the countdown), so you can tell a refresh is in flight rather than wondering if the numbers are stale.

## Caching

Snapshots are cached on disk and load instantly at launch, so you see your last-known values immediately instead of placeholders — even before the first fetch finishes. A cached value counts as fresh for one refresh interval; after that it still displays, but the next pass re-fetches it.

## When a fetch fails

A failed refresh **never wipes your data**: the last good values stay on screen, and a small warning triangle appears next to the provider's name — hover it for the error message (e.g. "Not logged in"). The error clears on the next successful refresh.

Rows that have never had data show "No data" rather than made-up numbers.
