# Claude

Tracks your Claude subscription limits using the login you already have from Claude Code.

## What it tracks

| Metric | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Session | 5-hour rolling window usage |
| Weekly | 7-day window usage |
| Sonnet | Separate weekly Sonnet limit (plan-dependent) |
| Extra Usage | Extra-usage credits spent against your monthly cap |
| Today / Yesterday / Last 30 Days | Local spend, as cost, tokens, or both (see below) |
| Plan | Your plan name (optional widget) |

## Where credentials come from

Sign in once with Claude Code; OpenUsage reads the same credentials, in this order:

1. `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` environment variable
2. `~/.claude/.credentials.json` (or `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/.credentials.json`)
3. The macOS keychain entries Claude Code maintains

Tokens are refreshed automatically; rotated tokens are written back where they came from.

## The spend tiles

Today / Yesterday / Last 30 Days are computed **locally** from your Claude Code logs by running `ccusage` through whichever JavaScript package runner you already have — [Bun](https://bun.sh) (`bunx`) is preferred, otherwise `pnpm dlx`, `yarn dlx`, `npm exec`, or `npx`. Each period is one tile showing cost and tokens together (`$4.08 · 1.2M tokens`); a day with no usage is a real zero and reads `$0.00 · 0 tokens`. The dollars are estimated from token counts (that's the ⓘ); the token counts themselves are measured. No log data leaves your Mac.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Not logged in"** — run `claude` and sign in, then refresh.
- **"Rate limited, retry in ~Nm"** — the usage API is throttling; OpenUsage shows when to expect data again and keeps your last values.
- **Spend tiles show "No data"** — OpenUsage needs a package runner on its `PATH` to run `ccusage`. Install [Bun](https://bun.sh) (`curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`), or make sure `npx`/`npm` is available (any Node.js install). If you use a version manager (nvm, fnm, volta), OpenUsage looks in the common locations, but a global Bun or Node install is the most reliable.

## Under the hood

`GET https://api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage` with the Claude Code OAuth token; refresh via `platform.claude.com/v1/oauth/token`. A 401/403 triggers one token refresh and retry.
