# Codex

Tracks your ChatGPT/Codex subscription limits using the login from the Codex CLI.

## What it tracks

| Metric | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Session | 5-hour rolling window usage |
| Weekly | 7-day window usage |
| Extra Usage | Flex credits, shown verbatim as dollars + credits (e.g. `$31.84 · 796 credits`) |
| Today / Yesterday / Last 30 Days | Local spend estimates (see below) |
| Plan | Your plan name (optional widget) |

## Where credentials come from

Sign in once with the Codex CLI (`codex`); OpenUsage reads the same auth files (`$CODEX_HOME` respected) with a keychain fallback. Tokens refresh automatically and rotate back into the auth file.

## The spend tiles

Today / Yesterday / Last 30 Days are computed **locally** from your Codex logs by running `ccusage` through whichever JavaScript package runner you already have — [Bun](https://bun.sh) (`bunx`) is preferred, otherwise `npx`, `npm exec`, `pnpm dlx`, or `yarn dlx`. The dollars are estimated from token counts — that's the ⓘ on those rows. No log data leaves your Mac.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Not logged in"** — run `codex` and sign in, then refresh.
- **API-key-only setups** can't read subscription usage — sign in with your ChatGPT account instead.
- **Spend tiles show "No data"** — OpenUsage needs a package runner on its `PATH` to run `ccusage`. Install [Bun](https://bun.sh), or make sure `npx`/`npm` is available (any Node.js install). If you use a version manager (nvm, fnm, volta), OpenUsage looks in the common locations, but a global Bun or Node install is the most reliable.

## Under the hood

`GET https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/wham/usage` with the Codex OAuth token; refresh via `auth.openai.com`. A 401/403 triggers one token refresh and retry.
