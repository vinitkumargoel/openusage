///
/// Why this signal and not key/focus: the popover keeps its SwiftUI view tree alive across open/close,
/// so transient UI state (edit mode, the add-widget gallery, scroll position) would otherwise persist
/// and reopen "stuck". We need a signal for "the popover went away" that does NOT fire when the user
/// merely clicks a control inside it. Key/resign-key fires on those clicks (breaking buttons), so it's
/// out.
///
/// Why it reports `window.isVisible` rather than the occlusion state: a `.canJoinAllSpaces` panel that
/// is open while the user switches macOS Spaces stays ordered-on (it follows them), but it is fully
/// *occluded* during the Space transition, so `occlusionState` drops `.visible` and then regains it.
/// Reporting occlusion directly mistook that for a dismissal and reset the still-open popover mid-switch
/// — which blanked the scroll content (the reset scrolls to top, drops the driven height, and resets the
/// screen) while the pinned chrome and the egg's gradient, living outside that subtree, kept rendering.
/// `isVisible` is true the whole time the panel is ordered-on (across Space switches and partial
/// occlusion) and flips to false only on a real `orderOut`, which is exactly the reset moment. Two
/// notifications wake the read — occlusion (open, close, Space switches) and the window becoming key
/// (every `makeKeyAndOrderFront`, which is the one that catches the *first* show; see `VisibilityView`)
/// — but the *value* reported is always `isVisible`, so a Space switch never reads as "gone".
