/// macOS 15 (Sequoia).
///
/// These are purely cosmetic fallbacks — they swap Liquid Glass styling for the established
/// pre-Tahoe controls (`.bordered` button styles, `.safeAreaInset`, no scroll-edge blur). Function
/// is preserved on every supported OS: the footer still pins, the buttons keep their active/inactive
/// distinction, the scroll view still scrolls. Nothing here hides a runtime error — each branch is a
/// compile-time `#available` check, which is the intended way to back-deploy newer-SDK APIs.

/// `SettingsScreen`, `DashboardView`) stay free of inline availability branches.
