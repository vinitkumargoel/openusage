///
/// These are purely cosmetic fallbacks — they swap Liquid Glass styling for the established
/// pre-Tahoe controls (`.bordered` button styles, `.safeAreaInset`, no scroll-edge blur). Function
/// is preserved on every supported OS: the footer still pins, the buttons keep their active/inactive
/// distinction, the scroll view still scrolls. Nothing here hides a runtime error — each branch is a
/// compile-time `#available` check, which is the intended way to back-deploy newer-SDK APIs.
///
/// These gate purely on OS version. The popover backdrop is always opaque (`StatusItemController`'s
/// `NSBox`, matching `Theme.traySurface`), with opaque grouped cards on it; glass is reserved for the
/// footer chrome — its frosted `.bar` material bar plus the interactive glass controls on it —
/// rendered in-window over that opaque backing.
///
/// Keeping every `#available(macOS 26, *)` check in this one file means the views (`HeaderView`,
/// `SettingsScreen`, `DashboardView`) stay free of inline availability branches.
