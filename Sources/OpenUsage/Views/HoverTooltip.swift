/// above the cursor, centered on it.
///
/// It's drawn in its own borderless, non-activating, click-through `NSPanel` — not a SwiftUI overlay.
/// A SwiftUI overlay lives inside the popover's window and is clipped to it (and to the dashboard's
/// scroll view), so it can't float freely the way a tooltip must. The panel sits one level above the
/// status-item popover (which is `.popUpMenu`): `orderFrontRegardless()` only orders the panel to the
/// front of its own level, so at the same level a later click that re-fronts the popover would bury the
/// tooltip behind it (issue #696) — a strictly higher level keeps it above regardless of front-ordering.
/// It never becomes key and never activates the app (shown via `orderFrontRegardless()`), which is the
/// documented carve-out that keeps it from dismissing the transient popover; `ignoresMouseEvents` makes
/// it click-through so it can't steal the hover that spawned it. The popover closing doesn't move the
/// cursor or tear down the (surviving) SwiftUI tree, so `HoverTooltips.dismissAll()` clears any live
/// tooltip from the status-item controller's hide path.
///
/// Usage: `.hoverTooltip(_:)` on any hover target. No root container is needed — the panel is a
/// separate window owned by `TooltipPresenter`.
