/// The grouped metric-card body shared by the live dashboard list and its lifted drag preview:
/// a spacing-0 stack of rows (separated by row padding, never dividers), the density gutter that
/// keeps the first/last row off the card edge, and the shared card surface. Both surfaces build the
/// card through this so the floating preview can't drift from the live card (it once hard-coded its
/// spacing and even drew dividers the live list doesn't).
///
/// The live list threads per-row gestures/opacity/frames through `rows`; the preview passes plain
/// `WidgetRowView`s and flips `lifted` for the legible material backing.
