/// height (`ScrollContentHeightKey` + the measured footer), and the host window is driven to that on
/// SwiftUI's animation clock (`drivesPanelHeight` / `PanelHeightModifier`) — so a screen switch morphs
/// the window height in lockstep with the slide (one spring), and the scroll views only take over once
