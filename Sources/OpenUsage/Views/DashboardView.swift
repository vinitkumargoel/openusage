///
/// The chrome is fixed: it's keyed off `layout.screen` and applied uniformly in `screenView`, so on a
/// screen switch only the content slides while the footer and top bar stay put. Each screen's scroll
/// content underlaps the footer with the native soft scroll-edge fade (`softBottomScrollEdge` →
/// `.scrollEdgeEffectStyle(.soft)`, macOS 26+) — Apple's blurred boundary, not a custom gradient or a
/// material bar. On macOS 15 the footer/top bar still pin via `safeAreaInset`, just without the blur
/// (content scrolls flush). The panel **auto-fits its content**: each screen publishes its intrinsic
/// height (`ScrollContentHeightKey` + the measured footer), and the host window is driven to that on
/// SwiftUI's animation clock (`drivesPanelHeight` / `PanelHeightModifier`) — so a screen switch morphs
/// the window height in lockstep with the slide (one spring), and the scroll views only take over once
/// content exceeds the screen-height cap.
