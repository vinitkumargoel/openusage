/// The dashboard footer's trailing control: a **split button** in Liquid Glass — one capsule with
/// "Customize" on the left and a chevron segment on the right, divided by a hairline (the Export ▾
/// idiom system apps use). Clicking "Customize" opens the Customize screen; clicking the chevron opens
/// the overflow menu (Settings / Check for Updates / About / Quit).
///
/// The joined-capsule look comes from one glass surface behind the *whole* control: an `HStack` of two
/// `.buttonStyle(.plain)` tap targets (a `Button` and a chevron `Menu`) split by a `Divider`, with a
/// single `interactiveGlass(in: Capsule())` drawn behind all of it. Glass goes on the container, not
/// each segment — per-segment glass would split it into two pills, and the system `.buttonStyle(.glass)`
/// renders flat on a `Menu` (its own button chrome wins). This is the canonical macOS 26 pattern
/// (custom `glassEffect` surface behind grouped controls); it falls back to a frosted material capsule
/// on macOS 15. The menu renders in its own `NSMenu`-backed window, which
/// `StatusItemController.shouldKeepPanelOpen` keeps the popover open for.
///
/// Only the dashboard shows this; the Customize and Settings screens carry their own top-leading back
/// button (`DashboardView.navBar`) to return home — the macOS-native place for it — so the footer
/// control simply drops away there.
///
/// Shortcuts survive: ⏎ (Customize), ⌘, (Settings) and Esc are handled by the always-on
/// `PopoverKeyReader` monitor, so they fire from every screen (including Settings, whose footer shows
/// only the identity line — no buttons). The menu items only carry their ⌘ key-equivalents as labels
/// and fire while the menu is open, so the monitor and the items never double-fire. ⌘Q (Quit) is
/// unowned elsewhere, so it rides its menu item directly.
