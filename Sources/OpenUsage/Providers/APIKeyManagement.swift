/// - `notSet`: no key in the environment or the saved file — the card offers an Add field.
/// - `fromEnvironment`: a key is present in the environment only — shown read-only, with an
///   override checkbox.
/// - `saved`: a key was saved via the app (written to the config file) and no env key is present —
///   "Connected", with Replace / Remove.
/// - `overrideActive`: a saved key is overriding a key also present in the environment — "Custom
///   key", with Edit / Clear override (clearing falls back to the env key).
